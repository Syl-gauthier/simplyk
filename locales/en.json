After interviewing people around him, he realized he was not the only one in this situation. He talked about his problem to Thibaut, who is passionate about web technology and sustainable development, and the project Simplyk was born. Since that day, we worked very hard on developing and proposing a web platform for volunteers. The first version was rolled out in July 2016, and every week since has known remarkable improvements.",
